# Flight-Price-Prediction
Analyzed a dataset of 300,153 flight bookings with 12 features, identifying key pricing patterns based on airline, departure time, stops, and class.
Performed data preprocessing, cleaning over 30,000 duplicate or missing entries, and encoding categorical variables for model training.
Developed and evaluated multiple machine learning models (Linear Regression, Lasso Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest) to forecast flight ticket prices.
Optimized model accuracy, achieving a 40% reduction in Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and 10% improvement in prediction accuracy using Random Forest Regression (MAE: 2,789, RMSE: 4,815).
Derived key insights that ticket prices increase by up to 50% as the departure date nears and that night departures have the highest fares.
Utilized Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn, NumPy, Matplotlib), applying regression analysis, feature engineering, and statistical hypothesis testing learned from coursework in predictive analytics and data visualization.
